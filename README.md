- **Music**

*She loves listening to music, she listens to music in any scenario. She listens to music when she's doing household chores, when she's washing her face, when taking a bath, going out on a trip, waiting in places, and many more. She listens to music just to overcome anxiety, to remove boredom, and to atleast have a little fun while doing something. Doesn't have any exact music genre type, when she likes a song then she adds it to her list. These are her Top 3 favorite music to listen to..*

- **Dancing and Singing**

*Both of these are her passion, she may be focusing on her dance skills rather than her voice though. She has been singing and dancing ever since she was a kid, she even though of being an Idol and audition in the future; Being an Idol is one of her dreams, but it may probably stay as a dream.*

-**Arts and Craft**

*She isn't an artist but she has always been doing arts and crafts. She likes to draw when she isn't doing much of things, she also watches videos just to make crafts that she can give to someone she loves.*
