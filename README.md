- music

She loves listening to music, she listens to music in any scenario; she listens to music when she's doing household chores, when she's washing her face, when taking a bath, going out on a trip, waiting in places, and many more. She listens to music just to overcome anxiety, to remove boredom, and to atleast have a little fun while doing something. Doesn't have any exact music genre type, when she likes a song then she adds it to her list; These are some of her favorite music to listen to..
